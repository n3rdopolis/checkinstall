Here's a list of things I would like to add, in no particular order.

If you can/want to contribute, send me a message: izto@asic-linux.com.mx

* Make it work with statically linked programs (see BUGS)
* Make it as portable as possible. I only tested installwatch with
  Linux, but it should work with other systems with <dlfcn.h>
  Solaris comes in mind
* Use autoconf
