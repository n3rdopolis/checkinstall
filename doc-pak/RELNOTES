Checkinstall 1.6.1
======================================

* Fixed the famous getcwd() bug (Thanks to David Brown for hunting it down!)

* Added translations:

  Indonesian -  Tedi Heriyanto
  Italian    -  Michele Petrecca
  Norwegian  -  cizu jones
  German     -  Andreas Muck
  Chinese    -  Xinkui Hao
  Japanese   -  UTUMI Hirosi

CheckInstall 1.6.0beta4
======================================
* This should be the last beta before releasing version 1.6.0. Please report
  any outstanding bugs!

* Fixed the bug in installwatch that caused segfaults when running on newer
  glibc versions (And therefore newer distros like FC and SuSe 9.1).

* The default for ADD_SO is now NO so we are no longer auto-updating
  /etc/ld.so.conf by default. If you need this behavior you can enable it
  with "--addso=yes" or by setting ADD_SO=1 in checkinstallrc.

* We use the new Slackware package format by default ( NEW_SLACK=1 ) when
  creating Slackware packages. Note that in previous versions of checkinstall
  up to 1.6.0beta3 the default was the old package format. 

* There are other smaller bugfixes. Read the Changelog file for details.

* New checkinstallrc options:

o MAKEPKG_FLAGS: makepkg optional flags. 

   These are recommended if running a newer Slackware version: "-l y -c n"

o SHOW_MAKEPKG: Boolean (Default: 0)

   Show -or not- the results of the MAKEPKG command as it runs. Useful when
   running it with interactive options. If checkinstall seems to halt and
   sleep after saying "Building Slackware package..." then you might want to
   set this to 1.

o ADD_SO: Boolean (Default: 0)
   Automatically search for shared libraries and add them to /etc/ld.so.conf?


CheckInstall 1.6.0beta3
======================================
* Internationalization support has been enhanced (And severely modified). 
  Many new languages have been added, too.

* Added a command line option: "--fstrans". It will allow you to enable
  or disable the filesystem translation code. It is enabled by default.

* Added a command line option: "--reset-uids". It will allow you to sanitize
  the file and directories permissions in the package. It will cause 
  checkinstall to set the permissions of all files and directories to "755"
  and the owner and group of all directories to root.root. DO NOT USE IT IF
  YOUR PACKAGE USES CUSTOM PERMISSIONS OR OWNERS.

* The problem many people had when copying the documentation files should
  now be fixed.

* The package information menu was moved to the first stages of the
  script. Now you can modify the package's name or version and the
  documentation directory will be correctly named.

* You can recycle a previously written .spec file, with the "--spec" command
  line option. It will work to set some package parameters even if you are
  building a Slackware or Debian package.

* CheckInstall will try to add to /etc/ld.so.conf the path to any ELF shared
  libraries it finds, and run ldconfig afterwards. This is added to the
  postinstall script of your package.

CheckInstall 1.6.0beta2
======================================

* Checkinstall 1.6.0 now sports brand-new internationalization support  :-).

  The supported languages so far are English and Spanish. Translators needed!

  If you want to contribute by translating Checkinstall to your language,
  please read the NLS_SUPPORT file for instructions on how to do it. It's very
  easy actually.

* Support for Slackware's tar-1.13 binary is included, the Slackware packages
  created by checkinstall should now be more Slackware-compatible than before.

* You can tell Checkinstall to use Slackware's native "makepkg" by setting
  the MAKEPKG variable to "makepkg" in checkinstallrc.

* Symlinks are now correctly detected again.

See more details in the ChangeLog.


CheckInstall 1.6.0beta1
======================================

* The "--install=<yes|no>" command line option indicates wether you want
  to actually install the package on your system or just create it 
  without installing it. This is a new feature and still in beta stage.
  Please test it and report any bugs you find (Or success, too!  :-) )

* In this release support for preinstall, postinstall, preremove and postremove
  scripts is introduced for RPM and Debian packages.

  For Debian, these scripts must meet some requirements to be accepted by dpkg
  while building the .deb package. See:

  http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html

  In short, any shell script will do as long as it specifies an interpreter
  (i.e. put #!/bin/sh as the first line) and has an exit status of zero for 
  success or non-zero for failure.

  To include the scripts in your package, put them in the current directory
  and name them:

  preinstall-pak
  postinstall-pak
  preremove-pak
  postremove-pak

  All scripts are optional. You can write all of them if you need them, or 
  only the ones you need, or even none.

  For Slackware packages, the "postinstall-pak" script is already supported as
  "install-pak". Either name will work.

  * This release also adds other three command line options: "--inspect", 
    "--review-spec" and "--review-control". See the ChangeLog file for 
    details.

CheckInstall 1.5.3
======================================

* The user's umask is ignored while creating/installing the package. If you
  really want to have the umask set to something unusual while checkinstall
  creates the package, you can use the "--umask" command line option.

  The default umask used by checkinstall is "0022" which is a standard,
  non-paranoid reasonable value.

* This version introduces support for the new Slackware description file format,
  whit handy-rule and all. Use the "--newslack" command line switch to activate
  it. The use of "--newslack" implies "-S", that is, it automatically selects
  the creation of a Slackware package.

CheckInstall 1.5.2
======================================

* This version introduces automatic man pages compression, enabled by default.
  You can control this option with the "--gzman" flag.

* The .deb packages created by checkinstall 1.5.2 should be a bit more
  Debian-friendly.

* There's a new shared library stripping feature in CheckInstall. Please test 
  it and report any trouble you might run into.

CheckInstall 1.5.1
======================================

* There's a new checkinstall mailing list! The list address is:
   <checkinstall-list@asic-linux.com.mx>

 To subscribe, send an empty message to: 
   <checkinstall-list-subscribe@asic-linux.com.mx>

* A new installwatch version is included, with some patches from Olivier
  Fleurigeon. The test program included with installwatch now works again.

* New command line options: "--docdir" and "--nodoc" to control the creation
  of the package documentation.

* New command line options: "--provides" and "--maintainer" to specify each
  value in the RPM spec file and in the Debian control file, respectively.

CheckInstall 1.5.0
======================================

* CheckInstall is now even more "scriptable", look for the "--pkgxxx" options
  in the README.
* The installwatch version (0.6.2) included with this release of checkinstall
  fixes a couple of file descriptor leaks that were present in 0.6.1. The
  "Too many open files" problem shouldn't appear again. I can no longer
  reproduce it with the Emacs21 installation, at least  ;-).
* Checkinstall is one year old! Version 1.0 was released on nov/11/200  =)


CheckInstall 1.5.0beta2:
======================================

* About the "invalid option" problem with rpm: the RPM folks have once again
  changed their minds about the rpm's argument parsing. In rpm versions < 4.0.0
  the right way was "--target <arch>", in 4.0.x with x < 3, it was
  "--target=<arch>" and finally in rpm 4.0.x with x >= 3 it is back to 
  "--target <arch>". CheckInstall now attempts to identify the installed rpm
  version and set this flag accordingly. If you have any problems about it, 
  please send me a mail message telling me the error message and the rpm version
  you have installed.

* Check the new PAK_DIR variable in the checkinstallrc file. If set to a 
  directory name, checkinstall will save there your newly created packages
  If the directory doesn't exist, checkinstall will ask you if it should be
  created. This should help you to keep all your new packages in one place.

* CheckInstall is now completely "scriptable"! If you give it the "-y" 
  command line option it will run completely unattended, accepting the 
  default answer to all questions.

CheckInstall 1.5.0beta1:
======================================

* Debian support is in place! Read the Debian packaging section of the
  README file. This is an experimental feature. Please report any bugs or 
  problems so they can be fixed  :).

CheckInstall 1.4.0:
======================================

A long time has passed since the last checkinstall release, thanks to my
final exams and an unusually big load of work. Now I have more free time and
will be working hard to add two important features: tracking of statically
linked binaries and .deb packaging format support. Stay tuned  :).

* I modified the installwatch library to make it backup any files modified
  by the install command, _before_ they are modified. This is done at the
  system call level.
 
  This allows checkinstall to write a tarball including all files that
  were overwritten/deleted/etc by the install command -i.e "make install"-,
  giving you the chance to return your system to the exact same state it was    
  before installing your program.                                      

  An example: suppose you have installed AfterStep, which by default keeps its
  global configuration files under /usr/local/share/afterstep,and you have
  customized them to meet your own tastes. Then you download and compile a new
  version, and then you install it with "make install" or with "checkinstall".

  You restart your afterstep session only to discover that all of your
  carefully configured files under /usr/local/share/afterstep have been
  overwritten by the installation process and substituted by the standard
  dist versions! Well.. that was until the arrival of CheckInstall 1.4  ;-)

  CheckInstall 1.4.0 would have saved all of those about-to-be-overwritten
  files just before they were modified, and wrote a tarball containing all
  of them. So in the example before, you'd just do a:

  tar xzvf backup-xxxxx-pre-afterstep-v.v.v.tgz -C / 

  And you'd get your files back. Nice, isn't it?

  Another nice thing is that if you cancel checkinstall at any time, it will
  automatically restore any already modified/overwritten files. 

  The xxxxx in the filename are a timestamp made with the date and time when
  the file was created, so you can run checkinstall multiple times and you'll
  get incremental-style backups of the modified files.

  The new installwatch library (0.6.0) has a lot of applications, I'll talk
  about them in installwatch's own documentation.

* CheckInstall now has full command line switches parsing.
  Try "checkinstall --help".

* The variable definition section inside the checkinstall script is gone.
  Now you should edit the checkinstallrc file, normally installed under
  /usr/local/lib/checkinstall

* Added an option ("--exclude") to tell checkinstall wich directories to ignore
  while searchig for modified files.

CheckInstall 1.3.2:
======================================

* Security fix for the temp dir, preventing symlink attacks.
* File names with spaces in them are now correctly handled.

CheckInstall 1.3.1:
======================================

* Fix for a bug found when using rpm 4.0, and new features.
* Slackware: If you create a script called "install-pak" inside the source
  directory, checkinstall will add it to the new package. The script will
  be run every time you install the package with Slackware's installpkg.
  This is useful for setting permissions, adding users and setting the system
  up after installing that package.




CheckInstall 1.3.0:
======================================

Lots of bug fixes and a couple of changes. Read the Changelog and the README.


CheckInstall 1.3.0beta3:
======================================
The bug that prevented checkinstall from working on your rpm-based distribution
has been fixed  -seems fixed, at least!-

So far I've tested v1.3.0beta3 in:

 o RedHat 6.2
 o Slackware 7.1

RedHat 7.x, SuSe and Mandrake should be OK but I haven't confirmed it. Maybe you
could do that and write me a note to include them on the list  ;-).

I've added a DEBUG flag to allow checkinstall to gather some useful info and
pack it in a tarball. Check the variable definition section inside the script.

CheckInstall 1.3.0beta :
======================================

RPM support is now included. See the bottom of the README for details.
This is a beta release, please report bugs and post comments to:

<fsanchez@uagunix.gdl.uag.mx>

CheckInstall 1.2.1 :
======================================

Because of a couple of bugs introduced by checkinstall 1.2, you may have to 
check the owner and permissions of /tmp and /var/checkinstalltmp :


/tmp ==> 1777/root:root
/var/checkinstalltmp ==> 0700/root:root

Just to make sure, run:

chmod 1777 /tmp
rm -rf /var/checkinstalltmp
mkdir /var/checkinstalltmp
chmod 0700 /var/checkinstalltmp
