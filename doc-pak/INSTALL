INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

Simple enough:

make
su
make install
checkinstall

"make install" goes first because we have no checkinstall installed yet :)

"checkinstall" goes latter so we can have a properly installed (and removable)
               package for checkinstall-1.6.1

               (Be sure to read the README if you're planning on building RPM or
                Debian binary packages)
                
               
This will install checkinstall-1.6.1, makepak (modified makepkg) and 
installwatch-0.7.0beta5
