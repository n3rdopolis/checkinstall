       The  file ffssttaabb contains descriptive information about the
       various file systems.  ffssttaabb is only read by programs, and
       not written; it is the duty of the system administrator to
       properly create and maintain this file.   Each  filesystem
       is  described  on a separate line; fields on each line are
       separated by tabs or spaces.   The  order  of  records  in
       ffssttaabb   is   important   because  ffsscckk(8),  mmoouunntt(8),  and
       uummoouunntt(8) sequentially iterate through ffssttaabb  doing  their
       thing.

       The  first  field,  (_f_s___s_p_e_c), describes the block special
       device or remote filesystem to be mounted.

       For ordinary mounts it will hold (a link to) a block  spe-
       cial  device  node (as created by mmkknnoodd(8)) for the device
       to be mounted, like `/dev/cdrom' or `/dev/sdb7'.  For  NFS
       mounts one will have <host>:<dir>, e.g., `knuth.aeb.nl:/'.
       For procfs, use `proc'.

       Instead of giving the device explicitly, one may  indicate
       the  (ext2 or XFS) filesystem that is to be mounted by its
       UUID or volume label (cf.   ee22llaabbeell(8)  or  xxffss__aaddmmiinn(8)),
       writing  LABEL=<label>  or UUID=<uuid>, e.g., `LABEL=Boot'
       or `UUID=3e6be9de-8139-11d1-9106-a43f08d823a6'.  This will
       make  the  system  more  robust: adding or removing a SCSI
       disk changes the disk device name but not  the  filesystem
       volume label.

       The second field, (_f_s___f_i_l_e), describes the mount point for
       the filesystem.  For swap partitions, this field should be
       specified  as  `none'. If the name of the mount point con-
       tains spaces these can be escaped as `\040'.

       The third field, (_f_s___v_f_s_t_y_p_e), describes the type  of  the
       filesystem.   The system currently supports these types of
       filesystems (and possibly others - consult  _/_p_r_o_c_/_f_i_l_e_s_y_s_-
       _t_e_m_s):

       _m_i_n_i_x  a  local filesystem, supporting filenames of length
              14 or 30 characters.

       _e_x_t    a local filesystem with longer filenames and larger
              inodes.   This  filesystem has been replaced by the
              _e_x_t_2 file system, and should no longer be used.

       _e_x_t_2   a local filesystem with  longer  filenames,  larger
              inodes, and lots of other features.

       _x_i_a_f_s  a  local  filesystem  with longer filenames, larger
              inodes, and lots of other features.

       _x_f_s    a local filesystem with journaling, scalability and
              lots of other features.

       _m_s_d_o_s  a local filesystem for MS-DOS partitions.

       _h_p_f_s   a local filesystem for HPFS partitions.

       _i_s_o_9_6_6_0
              a local filesystem used for CD-ROM drives.

       _n_f_s    a  filesystem  for  mounting partitions from remote
              systems.

       _s_w_a_p   a disk partition to be used for swapping.

       If _f_s___v_f_s_t_y_p_e is specified  as  ``ignore''  the  entry  is
       ignored.  This is useful to show disk partitions which are
       currently unused.

       The fourth field, (_f_s___m_n_t_o_p_s), describes the mount options
       associated with the filesystem.

       It  is formatted as a comma separated list of options.  It
       contains at least the type of mount  plus  any  additional
       options  appropriate to the filesystem type.  For documen-
       tation on the available options for non-nfs file  systems,
       see  mmoouunntt(8).   For  documentation  on  all  nfs-specific
       options have a look at nnffss(5).  Common for  all  types  of
       file  system are the options ``noauto'' (do not mount when
       "mount -a" is given, e.g., at  boot  time),  and  ``user''
       (allow a user to mount). For more details, see mmoouunntt(8).

       The  fifth field, (_f_s___f_r_e_q), is used for these filesystems
       by the dduummpp(8) command to determine which filesystems need
       to  be dumped.  If the fifth field is not present, a value
       of zero is returned and dduummpp will assume that the filesys-
       tem does not need to be dumped.

       The  sixth field, (_f_s___p_a_s_s_n_o), is used by the ffsscckk(8) pro-
       gram to determine the order in which filesystem checks are
       done at reboot time.  The root filesystem should be speci-
       fied with a _f_s___p_a_s_s_n_o of 1, and other  filesystems  should
       have a _f_s___p_a_s_s_n_o of 2.  Filesystems within a drive will be
       checked sequentially, but filesystems on different  drives
       will  be  checked  at the same time to utilize parallelism
       available in the hardware.  If the sixth field is not pre-
       sent  or  zero,  a value of zero is returned and ffsscckk will
       assume that the filesystem does not need to be checked.

       The proper way to read records from ffssttaabb is  to  use  the
       routines ggeettmmnntteenntt(3).

       The documentation in mmoouunntt(8) is often more up-to-date.
