CheckInstall installations tracker, version 1.6.1

CheckInstall  keeps  track of all the files created  or
modified  by your installation  script  ("make install"
"make install_modules",  "setup",   etc),   builds    a 
standard   binary   package and  installs  it  in  your 
system giving you the ability to uninstall it with your 
distribution's  standard package management  utilities.
