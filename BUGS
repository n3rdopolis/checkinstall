KNOWN BUGS
==========

* You can have some trouble if the source directory's path has white spaces in
  it, when building rpm packages or Slackware tarballs. These problems are
  caused by bugs in the packaging applications used in those systmes (Namely
  "rpm" and "installpkg"). Checkinstall makes it's best effort to work around
  these bugs, but you should try to avoid source directories' names with spaces.
  There's no problem when building Debian packages, though.

* Some directories are not removed when removing a checkinstall-generated
  rpm package.

* The installwatch library seems to have some problems with glibc-2.2.1. You
  should use glibc-2.2.2+

* There are problems when using installwatch and libsafe together
