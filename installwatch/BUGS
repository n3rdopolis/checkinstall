Here's a list of things that need to be fixed, in no particular order.

* Installwatch does not work with programs that statically link libc. 
  Uhm... I should take a look at strace(1)

* Due to LD_PRELOAD limitations, it does not work with suid binaries
  neither. Believe me, this is a very good thing anyway :-)

* mknod(2) is not watched
