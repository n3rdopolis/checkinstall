Installwatch has been tested on Linux only.

To compile it, a simple `make' followed by `make install' should do
the magic.

By default, it will install itself to /usr/local/{bin,lib}
but you can change that by specifying PREFIX during install as in

  make
  make PREFIX=/usr install

Also, for packagers and such, Makefile obeys DESTDIR ala Autotools.

You need an ELF system, but I don't think it's a problem today...

Don't forget to tell me your OS version, libraries version and every
other relevant detail.

If you want to try installwatch on itself for the first time, do
the following instead of `make install'.

Bash family:

LD_PRELOAD=./installwatch.so make install

Tcsh family:

setenv LD_PRELOAD ./installwatch.so ; make install

Of course, you must be root in the installwatch source directory.
Remember, if you belong to the tcsh family, LD_PRELOAD will remain
set after `make install', so be sure to clear the variable.
