20061101 -- 
* getwcd() patch from David Brown
* utimes() support from David Brown
* access() support from David Brown
* Makefile patch from Felipe Sateler

20040613 -- version 0.7.0beta4
* _init() patch

20031214 -- version 0.7.0beta3
* fopen64() patch

20030312 -- version 0.7.0beta2 -- Thomas Rausch
* Small patch for correct symlink call reporting

20021125 -- version 0.7.0beta1 -- olivier fleurigeon
* Added translation fs support

20011122 -- version 0.6.3 --  olivier fleurigeon <olivier.fleurigeon@cegedim.fr>
* Fixed the test-installwatch test program.

20011118 -- version 0.6.2  -- Felipe Sanchez 
* Fixed two other descriptor leaks that were causing the "Too many open files"
  problem when tracing large installations.

20011111 -- olivier fleurigeon <olivier.fleurigeon@cegedim.fr>
* Patched installwatch.c to trace the fopen() call

20010625 -- version 0.6.1 -- Felipe Sanchez <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
* Fixed the installwatch shell script to make it report the return status from
  the watched program

20010624 --  David Jarvie
* Patched create-localdecls to correctly detect the libc version in systems
  without a libc-2* file

20010610 -- Christian Tusche
* Patched installwatch.c to make it close the file descriptors in backup().
  This prevents the "Too many open files" problem when a watched program
  opens lots of files in one run (i.e. cp -vr / /some/dir)

20010608 -- version 0.6.0 -- Felipe Sanchez
* The backup actually works now  ;)

20010415 -- version 0.6.0beta -- Felipe Sanchez
* Added functions: backup() and makepath(). Installwatch now can make a backup
  of any file that will be overwritten or deleted by the true glibc functions.

20010301 -- version 0.5.6 -- Development now continued by 
                             Felipe Eduardo Sanchez Diaz Duran
                             <izto@asic-linux.com.mx>
* Removed the RTLD_NEXT line, we'll deal with all glibc's as if they were
  broken.
  
19990514 -- version 0.5.5
* Added support for glibc2.1 (used for example in RedHat 6.0)
* Added a test program (run "make test" to see if installwatch works
  correctly with your configuration)

19990331 -- version 0.5.4
* inst2rpm: patch from nbecker@fred.net to detect and use renamed
  and linked files (often used by install.sh scripts)

19990325 -- version 0.5.3
* Fixed canonicize(). It always returns absolute paths now
  Thanks to Jon A. Christopher <jon@quorum.tamu.edu>
* Renamed canonicize() to canonicalize(), which happens to be an
  existing word :-)
* Improved inst2rpm script from Jon

19981107 -- version 0.5.2
* Fixed a bug regarding non-absolute paths used with the -o option.
  Thanks to Jon A. Christopher <jon@quorum.tamu.edu> for pointing this
  out
* Greg Norris <haphazard@socketis.net> has volunteered to maintain then
  Debian package of installwatch. Thanks Greg!
* Added the contrib section. Thanks to
  Jon A. Christopher <jon@quorum.tamu.edu>, first contributor with the
  inst2rpm script. Very useful!

19980930 -- version 0.5.1
* Added libc5 support
* Cosmetic fixes on the documentation
* Removed support for mknod(2), I'll add it again later
