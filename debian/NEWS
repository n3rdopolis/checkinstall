checkinstall (1.6.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

   Filesystem translation is known to be broken recently due to a new set of
   system calls (the *at functions), which installwatch doesn't currently
   handle. This means that you should turn off filesystem translation until
   installwatch implements these calls.
