Native Language Support
=======================

Checkinstall now uses GNU gettext to support native language translation of
all messages sent to the terminal. Set your LC_ALL variable to your
ISO-639 language and ISO-3166 country codes. For example, to set spanish and
Mexico you would use:

export LC_ALL=es_MX


How to translate to your language
=================================

5 simple steps:


1) Edit the file checkinstall-template.po and fill in the msgstr lines with
   the translation for the phrase located in the matching msgid line.

Example:

- Original lines

msgid "Restoring overwritten files from backup..."
msgstr ""

- Translation to spanish:

msgid "Restoring overwritten files from backup..."
msgstr "Restaurando los archivos sobreescritos..."

2) After editing the file, save it as checkinstall-ll.po, where "ll" stands for 
   your language's ISO-639 two-letter code. In the case of the example, this
   would be "es" for spanish:

checkinstall-es.po

3) Now create the locale directory for your language. Remember to use the same
   ISO codes you use in your LC_ALL environment variable:

mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/checkinstall/locale/es_MX/LC_MESSAGES

4) Next, you should generate the .mo binary message file. Run msgfmt:

msgfmt -o /usr/local/lib/checkinstall/locale/es_MX/LC_MESSAGES/checkinstall.mo \
     checkinstall-es.po

(The above goes all in one line)

5) Finally, send me an e-mail message with the .po file attached so I can
   include it in the next checkinstall release  :-).
